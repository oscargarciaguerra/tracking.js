# tracking.js

Hi,

Thanks for stopping by (-:

This is my small project to gain a high level understanding on how http requests and cookies work.

I wanted to follow the whole client server flow and to create a simple web server that serves static content and is capable of reading http requests (post) and storing data in memory. 

The project also contains a mock website and some javascript code which mostly gets and sets cookie values. 

How to see it working:
1. npm install
2. node index.js
3. Browse to http://127.0.0.1:8888
4. Add data and submit form
5. Form submits are read on server and stored in memory (for now only logging shows this)
6. Use dev tools to check cookies (Resources)
